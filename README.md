The purpose of this assignment was to familiarize ourselves with tile editors for python arcade. What I created was a simple platformer where you collect coins and jump from platform to platform trying to get to the top of the map. To make my platformer more interesting, I made some of the platforms "coins" so that you fall right through the block and have to start over. Things I've learned from this game are how to create different layers in tile editor, how to make a simple platformer, and how to adjust the sizes of your character.
